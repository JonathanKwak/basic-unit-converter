# basic-unit-converter
Just a very basic application using the built-in TKinter to convert units.

# Features
- Detects invalid inputs (i.e, "asdagafgsfd" isn't a number and hence cannot be converted)
- Sets the visibility of the 'Convert' button based on if the current input is a valid number
- Converts things. Duh.

# Limitations
- Does not round in a nice/clean way, I avoided rounding altogether
- Does not contain more obscure units like stones
